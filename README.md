# Discord-AJ
Hi there! It's a simple bot written on Ruby and based on [discordrb](https://github.com/meew0/discordrb) gem.

You can use this as example of gem's usage or use it as your own bot by changing cfg file and something in `command.rb` > `bot_info`. Feel free to ask me, I will try to help you.

English version will be avaliable soon.

Additional gems that can be required:
* HTTParty (`gem install httparty`)
* JSON (included in Ruby by default)
