# Discord-AJ
Hi there! It's a simple bot written on Ruby and based on [discordrb](https://github.com/meew0/discordrb) gem.

You can use this as a bad example of gem's usage or use it as your own bot by changing cfg file and something in `command.rb` > `bot_info`.
Feel free to ask me, I will try to help you.

Additional gems that required:
* HTTParty (`gem install httparty`)
* Down (`gem install down`)
